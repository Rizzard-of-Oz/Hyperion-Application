Positive Aspects of the submission:

Great start on the program, we do however need to address a few aspects in your submission before we can mark it as complete.

Aspects of the submission that could be improved:

Line 2 has been indented incorrectly which is causing indentation errors on line 3,4,10 and 11.
"strs" seems to be not defined.
Please use more comments in your code, such as describing what your variables/each line of code do and a top-level comment explaining what is happening in this file.
