The creation of dictionary numbers for storing number words between zero and nine hundred ninety-nine takes place within the say Number function, and the space complexity of this dictionary is O(1) as it has a fixed size which does not change according to the input.

Subsequently, a new list called 'segments' is formed with each part of the figure split into groups of three digits so by breaking down the input number into sections made up of three digits each we can see that this list's length will not surpass log10(n) / 3 at most.  For this reason the space complexity of segments list is O(long)

After that point in time comes when this particular function creates a new list named 'segment Words', meant to contain all segments' respective word representations and at maximum capacity this list has a length equivalent to log10(n) / 3 and all words are scaled proportionally depending on their respective segment sizes.e In conclusion, we can say that segment Words’ space complexity is O (log n)

Lastly, after combining every individual segment's word representation along with their respective multipliers (like million or a billion) and related punctuations—it builds up an ultimate output string, and its length at most can be derived by adding a constant value C that usually relies on some factors such as the total amount of segments or their word representations.For that reason the output string has a space complexity of O (log n).

If you increase the value of 'n', expect an inefficient use of memory as it has been noted that Say number has a maximum amount owed to it denoted by log(n) and the reason for this occurrence can be attributed to a proportionality that exists between the lengths of both segments and segment Word lists relative to log10(n) but overshadowing other elements in terms of storage requirements are segments and segment words list. The maximum required size for numbers dictionary or output string is O(1) for logger 'n'
